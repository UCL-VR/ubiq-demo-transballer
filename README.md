Group coursework for COMP0090 Virtual Environments.

In Transballer, players work together building contraptions to channel balls from a spawn point to a hopper as fast as possible.

Use pipes, cannons and carts to overcome increasingly difficult environment obstacles across levels.

Transballer is best played in VR, but can be used with a Keyboard and Mouse. In addition to the Ubiq Desktop controls, use Q & E to rotate parts, either freely or around the snap axis, when snapped.
